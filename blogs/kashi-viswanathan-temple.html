            The name ERI is derived from the Assamese word ERA, which means
            \\\"castor\\\", as the silkworm feeds on castor plants. Eri silk is
            also known as endi or errandi in India. The woolly white silk is
            often referred to as the fabric of peace when it is processed
            without killing the silkworm. This process results in a silk called
            Ahimsa silk. Moths leave the cocoon and then the cocoons are
            harvested to be spun. \\r\\nEri silk is a staple fiber, unlike other
            silks, which are continuous filament. The texture of the fabric is
            coarse, fine, and dense. It is very strong, durable, and elastic.
            Eri silk is darker and heavier than other silks and blends well with
            wools and cotton. Due to its thermal properties it is warm in winter
            and cool in summer.\\r\\nEri silk fabric is a boon for those who
            practice absolut non-violence, not using any product obtained by
            killing any animal. It is widely used by everyone in the regions in
            which it is produced. It is becoming popular the world over.
            Buddhist monks in India, Bhutan, Nepal, China, and Japan prefer this
            silk, due to its non-violent origine
